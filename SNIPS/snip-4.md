## Simple Summary

A standard for writing comments in Cairo contracts.

Inspired by [Natspec](https://docs.soliditylang.org/en/v0.8.14/natspec-format.html) comments for Solidity.

## Abstract

The following standard provides a consistent way for Cairo contracts and their functionality to be documented. I propose that initially this should just be informational, however in future it could be integrated into the Cairo compiler to allow automated documentation generation. 


## Motivation

A comment standard increases the readability of contracts which makes it easier to ensure their correct functionality. 


## Specification

All tags are optional. The following table explains the purpose of each tag and where it may be used. 

| Tag     | Description                               | Context                                               |
|---------|-------------------------------------------|-------------------------------------------------------|
| @title  | Description of the cairo file             | header                                                |
| @author | Name and contact details of the author(s) | header                                                |
| @notice | Explain to an end user what this does     | header, storage variable, function, event, interface  |
| @dev    | Explain to a developer any extra details  | header, storage variable, function, event, interface  |
| @param  | Documents a parameter                     | storage variable, function, event                     |
| @return | Documents a return variable               | storage variable, function                            |

### Headers 

A header comment is a comment block that can be placed at the top of each cairo file, immediately following the imports. The header contains general information about the contents of the file including a brief description and an author.

### Arrays 

When working with arrays, @param and @return tags should only be applied to the pointer variable and not for the length.  One can document the contents of the array in this single tag.

# @title Simple Savings Account
# @author Vitalik Buterin - vitalik.buterin@ethereum.org
# @notice A contract to track users' savings in various pots
#

# @dev Stores the balances of each pot
# @param address: Address of the user
# @param pot_index: Index of the pot
# @return amount: The amount stored
@storage_var
func balance(address : felt, pot_index : felt) -> (amount : felt):
end

# @dev Updates a user's balance in a specified pot
# @param amount: Amount to increase the balance by
# @param pot_index: Index of the pot
@external
func increase_balance{syscall_ptr : felt*, pedersen_ptr : HashBuiltin*, range_check_ptr}(
    amount : felt, pot_index : felt
):
    let (address) = get_caller_address()
    let (current) = balance.read(address, pot_index)
    balance.write(address, pot_index, current + amount)
    return ()
end
```
